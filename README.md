# SingleCell_AD_Plaque
The dominant idea used to explain the pathophysiology of AD in recent years is the amyloid hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, some studies have been done to monitor transcriptional changes occurring near the Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque niche to better comprehend AD pathophysiology. Multiple cell types, such as astrocytes and microglia, were observed to enrich around the Aβ plaque. Therefore, more research, such as integrating single-cell transcriptomics, is required to identify the cell-cell communications (CCCs) between these plaque associated cells (PACs) and how they contribute to the cascade in AD. CellphoneDB and NicheNet are two publicly available repositories to study CCCs. This thesis will utilize CellphoneDB and NicheNet to find some potential ligand-receptor interactions in CCCs between PACs. These two methods have different algorithms, which complement one another's shortcomings, and at the same time, have room for improvement. Through these two methods, 18 potential ligand-receptor interactions were found. More research should be done on these ligand-receptor interactions because they are probably involved in the CCCs between PACs.
